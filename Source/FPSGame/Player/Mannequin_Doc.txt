/* Fire */
Fire Function is Locally BlueprintCallable funtion, which is called from AnimBlueprint, because Stone spawn and movement is executed in certain time of Animation sequance
but befor call Fire function must be checked, it executed for LocallyController. otherwise it will be executed twice for Client

/* Replication Fire Anim */
for fire Animation we use RPC and Multicas. RPC need to run Animation in Server side. Multicas need to run Animation every Client beind LocallyController, 
we need Multicast for SimulatedProxy.
For LocallyController we Use Locally Function to run fire Animation
we use such one by one Execution because AnimMontage can't be Replicated as simple variable

Befor Fire Anim we need to update server Aiming variable. It must be happened befor Fire Anim executed, outcome this for Aiming Var we use seperate RPC.
we update Aiming Var locally and then in Server side.

/* Stone Replication */
Stone Object Player spawn only in Server and in terms of that Stone object is Replicated it also appear for all Client
Main thing here is: Stone movement Endlocation is calculate in LineTrace() Functino in FPSPlayerAiming class. Endlocation is membar var of FPSPlayerAiming class
and if it is not Replicated var Client and Server side Endlocation does not match echother.

/* Two Version of Fire */
We calculate two version of Fire Aiming Fire and Random fire and this Execution is depened on Anim Var.
for Aiming Fire version we use LineTrace() and SuggestPorjectily() to calculate Stone trajectory.

But for Random Fire version we not calculate any trajectory. Simple throw the Stone.
but I want the throw direction will be same as Camera looking direction and it's required Actor Rotation in same direction as Camera looking at
but Actor Rotation in Server and Client side is not Simple thing
For HostPlayer it's executed OK, But for Client is not.
Client Rotation in Camera looking Direction is executed in Server side but not Client side
(because Rotation first is executed in Client side therefor client translation and server translation is not match eachother. such case Server win, Client doesn't rotate.
then by the RPC Rotation is executed in server side Clinet's Copy in server side is rotated and result locally Client rotation is not changed) I use RPC, ReplicatedUsing but nothing worked
At last I use Tick() function because after RPC Tick() must correct difference in Rotation in Clinet side.
